                This project was developed as part of an Interaction Design module undertaken in National University of Singapore whereby
                Travel planning has always been a tedious and arduous process whereby many factors including cost and time has to be taken into consideration.
                Although there are many 'travel planning' apps in the market, none really stood out and more often than not, travellers have to fall back on traditional modes of planning - through the use of pen and paper - or google drive (for collaboration).
                <br><br>
                Mytinerary is an integrated travel-planning application that enables travellers to plan out their ititerary seamlessly. Travellers would be able to add their travel documents (flights/reservations/etc) into Mytinerary for a one-stop integrated application.
                <br><br>
                This project is still in progress.

                Heavy emphasis was placed in defining the target audience and conducting user research to better redefine and scope the product. Both interviews and survey were conducted to better understand the pain-points of travel planning from the users standpoint. I conducted an interview with a user from our identified age group of young adults (aged 18-35) the results of the interview resonated with me.

                It is always important to conduct interviews (or other forms) to better understand the pain-points from the user's point of view. As this whole product stemmed from the pain-points that I particularly felt while on exchange (especially during the travelling phase), I had to take a step back and re-evaluate and gain different persepectives as we may not be facing the same issue. It is always useful to plan for more interviews, in the case whereby the conducted interview may not be as useful (the team decided to drop a user group) there are substaintial interviews or claims to support your problem/product.

                Differing experiences with Mobile OS-es will result in different designs. As I have always been an Apple user with no experience with Android devices, I had no clue on the design nuances on Android. As a result, we had different ideas on the placements of certain buttons (e.g. navigation menu, back button, etc). The specific design of OS was not discussed prior to the prototyping stage, and that was the main reason as to the design for different OS. As a team, it is always important to convey expectations and set a baseline for design. This will be very important in the development of interactive prototype as the final product will be a unified design from the team.
