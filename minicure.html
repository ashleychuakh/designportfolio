        <h3>Overview-</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <p>
                Minicure was created as part of a module (Business and Technical Communication) undertaken in National University of Singapore. The idea of the project stemmed from Shark Tank, a popular TV show where participants are required to pitch their business idea under 5 minutes. As such, Minicure is developed. <br><br>
                The prevalent use of Internet Banking has posed a serious information security threat; where sophiscated trojan can be built with the capability of keylogging and stealing user's password. Even with the use of 2-Factor Authorization (2FA) through the use of tokens and SMS-es, this is not secure enough.
                Aside from the security flaw of independent bank tokens, users of multiple banks face the issue of handling and carrying mutltiple bank tokens that are easily damaged or have faulty batteries. As such, these tokens are often left at home and used only when needed.

        <div class="row">
            <p class="">The focus of this project was on the business idea, where majority of time was spent to forumlate and devise the best working idea.
                To better understand and redefine our target user group, primary research was conducted through surverys to better understand the willingness to adopt a new technology and the pain points of the current problem.

                Moving forward, I hope that I would be able to review this business idea again as internet banking will still be widely used, along side the rise of mobile payments and wallet. With the newly gained knowledge on interaction design, I hope to be able to futher improve the interaction of the design - as it is currently rather plain where only the key purpose is designed for. As interaction design is not only limited to websites/mobile apps, it also extends out to hardware devices. This would be a great platform to design a seemingly unassuming device with an added modern twist such that it caters to the larger group of users (youngsters).

                Following which, heuristic evaluations from Nielsen and Molich can be adopted and adapted to benchmark the product against certain guidelines and use it as a way to improve the interactivity and usability of the product. This should be conducted in iterative rounds of user-evaluation process.
